```

The tool will automatically detect your AWS CLI configuration if available. You'll be prompted for:

**Option A: Use AWS CLI (Recommended)**
- The tool will auto-detect your AWS CLI configuration
- Just confirm to use AWS CLI credentials when prompted
- Region and Account ID will be detected automatically

**Option B: Manual Credentials**
- **AWS Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Your AWS secret key
- **AWS Region**: The AWS region where your pipelines are located (default: us-east-1)
- **AWS Account ID**: Your AWS account ID (12-digit number)

**For both options:**
- **Pipeline names**: Comma-separated list of pipeline names to monitor
- **CodeBuild project names**: Comma-separated list of CodeBuild project names to monitor

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in the standard configuration directory:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/aws-pipeline-watcher/config.yml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\aws-pipeline-watcher\config.yml`

**Using AWS CLI with SSO (Recommended):**
```yaml
use_aws_cli: true
aws_profile: default
aws_region: us-east-1
aws_account_id: "123456789012"
pipeline_names:
  - my-pipeline-1
  - my-pipeline-2
codebuild_project_names:
  - my-build-project-1
  - my-build-project-2
```

**Using Manual Credentials:**
```yaml
use_aws_cli: false
aws_access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
aws_region: us-east-1
aws_account_id: "123456789012"
pipeline_names:
  - my-pipeline-1
  - my-pipeline-2
codebuild_project_names:
  - my-build-project-1
  - my-build-project-2
```

### AWS SSO

For AWS SSO users, if credentials expire during monitoring, the tool will display an error message. Simply run `aws sso login` in another terminal to authenticate again.

## Usage

### Monitor Pipelines

Start monitoring your configured pipelines and CodeBuild projects:

```bash
./bin/aws-pipeline-watcher
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aws-pipeline-watcher` | Start monitoring (default command) |
| `aws-pipeline-watcher watch` | Start monitoring (explicit) |
| `aws-pipeline-watcher config` | Configure AWS credentials, pipelines, and CodeBuild projects |
| `aws-pipeline-watcher help` | Show help information |

## Display Format

The tool displays pipeline and CodeBuild project information in this format:

```
‚Ä¢ item-name
  Current Step/Phase | timer
  commit-hash: commit-message
```

### Step/Phase Colors

- üü¢ **Green**: Completed steps/phases
- üî¥ **Red**: Failed steps/phases  
- üü° **Yellow**: Currently running steps/phases
- üîµ **Cyan**: Neutral/informational steps
- üü† **Light Red**: Stopped pipelines

### Field Descriptions

- **item-name**: Name of the CodePipeline or CodeBuild project (displayed on first line)
- **Current Step/Phase**: Shows the specific pipeline stage:action or build phase that is currently running or failed, rather than generic "InProgress"/"Failed" status
- **timer**: Duration the pipeline/build has been running or since completion
- **commit-hash**: Short Git commit hash (first 8 characters)
- **commit-message**: Clean commit message extracted from source revision (automatically parses GitHub/CodeCommit JSON format)
- **error-details**: For failed pipelines/builds, up to 2 lines of actionable error information (‚ö†Ô∏è icon)

### Step-Focused Display

The tool prioritizes showing the current step/phase rather than generic status:
- **Pipeline Steps**: Shows specific stage and action (e.g., "Build:BuildAction", "Deploy:DeployAction") instead of just "InProgress"
- **Build Phases**: Shows current build phase (e.g., "INSTALL", "BUILD", "POST_BUILD") instead of generic "In progress"
- **Completion Status**: Shows "Completed" for successful executions rather than "Succeeded"
- **Failure Details**: Shows the specific step/phase that failed (e.g., "Deploy:DeployAction (FAILED)")
- **Color Coding**: Green for completed, yellow for running, red for failed, cyan for informational
- **Real-time accuracy**: Shows the true current state of your pipelines and builds
- **Multi-service support**: Unified display for both CodePipeline and CodeBuild with consistent formatting
- **Smart commit parsing**: Automatically extracts clean commit messages from JSON metadata provided by GitHub and CodeCommit

### Error Details for Failed Pipelines

When pipelines or builds fail, the tool automatically displays helpful debugging information:
- **Error messages**: Direct error messages from AWS CodePipeline actions and CodeBuild phases
- **Failure summaries**: Additional context from build/test/deploy tools and build logs
- **Smart truncation**: Long messages are shortened for terminal readability
- **Compact display**: Shows up to 2 lines of error details to maintain clean interface
- **Visual indicators**: Red warning icons (‚ö†Ô∏è) highlight error details
- **No configuration needed**: Error details appear automatically for failed pipelines and builds
- **CloudWatch integration**: CodeBuild failures show relevant log group information when available
